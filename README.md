# Forumeong
A WIP project to build a forum using Spring-Boot and Firebase 

This is a REST API.
You can find the frontend repo for the project [here](https://github.com/Sunset-06/Forum-Frontend)

Transfer the contents of the frontend build directory to ```src/main/resources/static```

You need to add the account key that firebase provides [By default called serviceAccountKey.json] to your project. 
Start working immediately by just adding it to the root directory

Start the server by using:
```
mvn run:spring-boot
```
